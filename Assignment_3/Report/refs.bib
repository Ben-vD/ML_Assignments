    abstract={Decision Trees are considered to be one of the most popular approaches for representing classifiers. Researchers from various disciplines such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, and Data Mining have dealt with the issue of growing a decision tree from available data. This paper presents an updated survey of current methods for constructing decision tree classifiers in a top-down manner. The chapter suggests a unified algorithmic framework for presenting these algorithms and describes various splitting criteria and pruning methodologies.},

  abstract = {Summary The technique set out in the paper, chaid, is an offshoot of aid (Automatic Interaction Detection) designed for a categorized dependent variable. Some important modifications which are relevant to standard aid include: built-in significance testing with the consequence of using the most significant predictor (rather than the most explanatory), multi-way splits (in contrast to binary) and a new type of predictor which is especially useful in handling missing information.},
